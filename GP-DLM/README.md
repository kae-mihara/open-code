This package (GP-DLM) is the group pooling deep learning algorithm for tourism demand forecasting. Please be aware that:

* The pooling stage will need run the extra dynamic time warping clustering for generating the pooling group. 
* Pooling data is generated separately.
* The training of DLM needs extra efforts based on specific data set, and direct running of the provided code *DOES NOT* always generate the promised performance.
* For the training of the model on the data set, please spend your own patient time and the code publisher will *NOT* provide assistance on this issue.

###  Requirements
---

* Python 3.6
* Keras 2.2 (2.3 won't work for the weights saving)
* Tensorflow


---
###  Run the coder
---

* Setting up the pooling data by using Dynamic_time_warping.py and pooling.py
* Feeding the pooled data into DLM by using DLM.py and configuration.py
* Run the forecasting.py
