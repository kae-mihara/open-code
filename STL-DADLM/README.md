This package (STL-DADLM) is the deep learning algorithm for tourism demand forecasting with STL decomposition. Please be aware that:

* The training of DLM needs extra efforts based on specific data set, and direct running of the provided code *DOES NOT* always generate the promised performance.
* For the training of the model on the data set, please spend your own patient time and the code publisher will *NOT* provide assistance on this issue.
